/*
 If we want to get objects one by one from the collection then we should go for cursor. 
There are 3 types of cursors available in java. They are:  
1. Enumeration  
2. Iterator  
3. ListIterator  

Enumeration:
   1. We can use Enumeration to get objects one by one from the legacy collection 
    objects. 
   2. We can create Enumeration object by using elements() method.  
    public Enumeration elements();  
    Enumeration e=v.elements(); 
    using Vector Object
