/*
C++, string is not a fundamental or built-in data type like int or char.
 Instead, it is part of the C++ Standard Library (under the std namespace)
  and is implemented as a class.*/

// like java cpp have method substr
/*
Yes, C++ has a method for substrings, though it's not called substringâ€”it's named substr,
 and it's a member function of the std::string class. 
 You can use it to extract a portion of a string.*/
